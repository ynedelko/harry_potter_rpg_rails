if you get error PG::Error: ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint
run in rails console:
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables.each { |t| ActiveRecord::Base.connection.reset_pk_sequence!(t) }

Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
// Great README! The user instructions were great, and it was really helpful to have both admin & user logins.
Is there good spec coverage?
// There are a few specs for the item and user models. The other model & integration specs are missing. (Understandable given the short time-frame...)
Do all specs pass?
// Yes :)
Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
// It's a logical and enjoyable user experience :)
Is the site user-friendly?
// Yes
Are there opportunities for refactoring?
// Since there are models you're not using, you can delete some of them.
What features stand out?
// I really like that you have both an admin & a user option. The welcome is very inviting, and I really like that your 'inventory basket' is always visible!
What features could be improved?
// On the admin screen, got an error when I tried to add a new item to a location.
Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
//As a user, when you finish adding an item, you don't know what to do next. Maybe you could offer the user a recommendation to choose another location?
This is a really great start, and I enjoyed looking around! Also, it's great that you 'seeded' your database. Great job! I can imagine the potential & I would love to play your game :)
